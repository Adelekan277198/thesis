% Content: The main file of the diploma thesis template (master's/engineering).
% Prepared by: Tomasz Kubik <tomasz.kubik@pwr.edu.pl>
% Date: January 2023
% Version: 0.9
% Requirements: pdflatex compiler
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass[a4paper,onecolumn,oneside,12pt,extrafontsizes]{memoir}
% To prepare a printout for the archive, you can:
% a) prepare a PDF in which two pages will be inserted on one physical page and print such a document on both sides (recommended approach)
%
% Such a document can be prepared via:
% - printout from Adobe Acrobat Reader with the "Multiple" option - "Page size and handling" section
% - use of psutils tools
%
% Windows (assuming the MiKTeX distribution includes the miktex-psutils-bin-x64-2.9 package):
% "c:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64\pdf2ps.exe" Dyplom.pdf Dyplom.ps
% "c:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64\psnup.exe" -2 Dyplom.ps Dyplom2.ps
% "c:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64\ps2pdf.exe" Dyplom2.ps Dyplom2.pdf
% Del Dyplom2.ps Dyplom.ps
%
% Linux:
% pdf2ps Diplom.pdf - | psnup -2 | ps2pdf - Diplom2.pdf
%
% b) recompile the document by reducing the font size (this approach is not recommended because it changes the formatting of the document)
%
% To do this, just use the following commands (instead of documentclass from the first line):
% \documentclass[a4paper,onecolumn,twoside,10pt]{memoir}
% \renewcommand{\normalsize}{\fontsize{8pt}{10pt}\selectfont}

%\usepackage[cp1250]{inputenc} % Please leave if the encoding of the edited files is cp1250
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Please use instead of above if the encoding of the files you are editing is UTF8
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[polish,english]{babel} % The order of attributes is important here (for work in Polish, Polish should be at the end)
%\DisemulatePackage{setspace}
\usepackage{setspace}
\usepackage{color,calc}
%\usepackage{soul} % package with commands for underlining, underlining, highlighting text (rather unnecessary)
\usepackage{ebgaramond} % garamond font package, needed only for the title page, must appear before the tgtermes package

%% To obtain Polish letters in PDF (and not conglomerates) we use the tgterms font package.
%% This package defines Times font clones with the following shapes: normal, bold, italic, bold italic.
%% This package is missing a slanted font (similar to Italic).
%% If the slanted font is used anywhere in the document (e.g. after using the \textsl{} command), then
%% latex will substitute the standard font and report this in a warning.
%% Also, tgtermes is a font for the text. Any mathematical formulas will be formatted in the default formula font.
%% If patterns are to be formatted with different fonts, this must be explicitly declared.

%% After installing the tgtermes package, you may need to update the information
%% about available fonts and maps. You can do this from the console (as administrator)
%% initexmf --admin --update-fndb
%% initexmf --admin --mkmaps

% Package provides lstlisting environment. It is highly customizable.
% You can configure each listing individually or globally using the \lstset{} command.

% It is recommended that the source code be output using the \ttfamily typewriter font
% Because the source code, even when truncated to interesting parts, can be large, you should reduce the font size.
% \small (for short snippets) and \footnotesize (for longer snippets) are recommended.

% Additionally, you can declare the line numbering method during configuration. However, line numbering is recommended
% only in cases where there are some references to specific lines in the text being edited.
% If there are no such references, line numbering is unnecessary. Please do not use it then.
% When enabling line numbering, pay attention to where these numbers appear.
% Without changing additional parameters, they appear in the margin of the page (which is undesirable).

	}
	
	% If the edited file is not in cp1250 encoding, there is a problem with Polish characters appearing in the inserted code.
	% Therefore, when working on files in UTF8 encoding, you need to declare the mapping as below (just unmark).
	% Unfortunately, when using this mapping, you may encounter problems with syntax highlighting (see below).

%% lstlisting allows you to style syntax highlighting of selected languages.
%% This works by defining key words and how they are displayed.
%% Because this is a simple mechanism, it is sometimes difficult to achieve the results that IDE tools can provide.
%% However, in most cases the results achieved are satisfactory.


%% lstlisting supports several of the most popular languages by default.

% BIBLIOGRAPHY (will be generated automatically)
%NOTE: You must prepare the references' library yourself. A good tool for this is JabRef.
% JabRef, however, offers more record types than BibTeX supports.
% Please do not declare records of types not supported by BibTeX.
% The list of references and citations is formatted in accordance with the declared style.
% Styles that produce numeric citations (in the form [1], [2,3]) are recommended.
% Such a style is, for example, plabbrv
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
% To control spacing in the literature list, you can use the following command
\setlength{\bibitemsep}{2pt} % - narrows the list
% The bibliography items appears in the table of contents slightly differently than lists of figures, tables, etc.
% To maintain the correct spacing, use the following command
%\addtocontents{toc}{\addvspace{2pt}} % we set the space in the table of contents before the Literature item
% The file name of the prepared library is entered without the .bib extension
% (the line below loads records from the file "bibliography.bib")
