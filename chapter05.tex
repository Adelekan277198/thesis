Uses PHP for server-side processing, handling requests from the front end and interacting with the database. The server will manage user sessions, authenticate users, and process CRUD operations.

Facilitates communication between the front-end application and the database. The API will support operations for user management, location management, and content management.

\subsubsection{Data Layer}
A MySQL relational database designed to store and manage all data related to locations, administrative details, user information, and more. The database schema is normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

Handles the integration of data from various sources, including public APIs (e.g., OpenStreetMap), manual data entry, and bulk uploads. This module ensures that data is accurately imported and mapped to the database schema.

\subsubsection{Security Layer}
Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access specific features. User passwords are securely stored using hashing algorithms.

\subsection{Implementation Details of Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Management}
The system provides a robust user management framework that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. During registration, users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password. The system validates these inputs and securely stores the credentials. Upon successful registration, users gain access to their accounts through the login feature. Additionally, the system includes mechanisms for password management, enabling users to reset forgotten passwords securely via email verification and token-based authentication. Admin users are equipped with elevated privileges, allowing them to manage user accounts, review content, and perform other administrative tasks efficiently.

\subsubsection{Location Management}
The location management functionality enables users to search for and discover locations using various criteria, such as name, postal code, and alternative names. The search functionality is optimized for quick data retrieval, ensuring users can find relevant information promptly. Detailed information about each location, including its description, founding year, and alternative names, is displayed. Authorized users have the capability to add new locations, complete with relevant details, ensuring the database remains comprehensive and up-to-date.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Storage}
To ensure data quality, automated scripts and manual review processes were implemented to identify and merge duplicate records, handle missing values, and correct errors. Techniques such as imputation and normalization were used to maintain data integrity.

Data was normalized to fit the relational database schema, ensuring each piece of data is stored in the appropriate table and field. New features were created from raw data to enhance the database, such as calculating population density from area size and population data. Data from multiple sources was merged, resolving conflicts and discrepancies through predefined rules and priority settings. Schema mapping was employed to align data from different sources with the existing database schema.

\subsection{Security Implementation}
Robust security measures were implemented to protect user data and system integrity. Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions. PHP's built-in cryptography extension was used for password hashing, securely storing user passwords. Additionally, users are provided with mechanisms to reset forgotten passwords securely through email verification and token-based authentication.

In conclusion, the implementation of the Place Names Information System (PNIS) involved meticulous planning and execution across multiple development stages. From front-end and back-end development to data acquisition, preprocessing, and security implementation, each component was carefully crafted to ensure a comprehensive, reliable, and user-friendly system.
