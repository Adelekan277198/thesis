Administrative details provide the foundation for understanding the geographical and administrative context of a place name. The system enhances searchability and discovery by incorporating various names a place name may have, thus improving data accessibility. Geographical features offer a deeper understanding of a place nameâ€™s physical characteristics, while historical data enrich place names with stories and events that have occurred over time.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Management}
Users will be able to register, login, and logout. The application will authenticate users based on securely stored usernames and passwords and will implement mechanisms to reset forgotten passwords. An admin user type will exist with elevated privileges.


\subsubsection{Place Name Management}
Users will be able to search for place names based on various criteria such as name and postal code. The application will display details of a place name including its description, founding year, geographical features, historical events, and alternative names with voice recordings to help with pronunciation. Only authorized users will be allowed to add new place names. They should declare all details for a new place to ensure consistency.

\subsubsection{Content Management}
Users will be able to create and submit posts related to place names. The system will implement a~workflow for administrators to approve or reject posts. Users will be able to view posts associated with specific place names and add comments to existing posts.

\subsubsection{Administrative Functions}
Admin users will be able to manage user accounts, update administrative details, and potentially manage other aspects of the data.

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Performance}
The system shall be capable of handling large volumes of data efficiently. Data retrieval and query processing shall be optimized for responsiveness, and algorithms for data acquisition shall be designed for scalability and performance.

\subsubsection{User Roles and Security}
Access to the system is role-based, providing different levels of access to the information system for users and administrators. Guests can only search and view place name details. Signed-up users can post comments, and add new place names. Administrators have the authority to approve user posts, modifications and suspend users. To ensure confidentiality and integrity, user passwords are encrypted within the system. Additionally, robust measures are in place to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

The system supports the following user roles with their specific functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Guests} -- are greeted with a search bar that enables them to look up place names and access information about geographical features, alternative names with voice recordings, and administrative details in a table format. They are unable to make posts or submit new place names.
\item \textbf{Users} -- register through a registration form and can log in, reset their passwords if forgotten, and share their experiences by creating posts related to a place. They can also add new place names with detailed information. All user-generated content, such as posts and new place names, must be approved by an admin before becoming visible to other users.
\item \textbf{Admins} -- have a separate login form that directs them to a dedicated dashboard. In this dashboard, admins can approve or reject posts and place names, make users inactive or remove them, and see statistics about the data, such as the number of posts created and their associations with place names.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Specification}
The Place Names Information System (PNIS) is designed to record, manage, and analyze data related to place names and their attributes. The system aims to provide a comprehensive platform for users to explore and learn about various place names in Edo-Benin City. Below is a detailed blueprint of the system architecture, illustrating how the requirements were implemented.

\subsection{System Architecture Overview}
The architecture of PNIS is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, ensuring that it can efficiently handle large volumes of data and provide a robust user experience.

    \label{fig:dataModel}
\end{figure}
The \texttt{administrativedetails} table stores administrative area information such as country, state, and local government. The \texttt{administrative\_ass} table stores associations between administrative areas and specific identifiers (\texttt{location\_id}) during a specific period. The \texttt{admin\_actions} table tracks actions taken by administrators on the system, including affected users or posts. The \texttt{alternativenames} table stores alternative names for locations. The \texttt{comments} table stores information about comments made on posts, including the content and the user who created it. The \texttt{geographicalfeatures} table stores geographical features associated with locations, including type, location data, and descriptions. The \texttt{historical\_data} table stores historical data and events related to locations, including event descriptions, sources, and dates. The \texttt{locations} table contains information about specific place names, including name, postal code, founding year, and descriptions. The \texttt{posts} table stores posts created by users, including content, approval status, and creation time. The \texttt{users} table stores information about users, including username, password, email, profile information, and account status.
\item \textbf{Security Layer} -- implements role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access specific features. User passwords are securely stored using hashing algorithms. Guests can search and view place name details, users can create posts and add new place names, and admins can manage posts, place names, and user accounts.
\end{itemize}

The system facilitates communication between the front-end application and the database. The designed API support operations for user management, place name management, and content management. The system handles the integration of data from various sources, including public APIs (e.g., OpenStreetMap), manual data entry, and bulk uploads. This module ensures that data is accurately imported and mapped to the database schema.

\subsection{Workflow and Processes}
To illustrate the workflow and processes within the PNIS, a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram is used. This diagram provides a visual representation of the interactions between different user roles (guests, users, admins) and the system functions.
