\textbf{Ancient Chronicles:} The investigation of ancient chronicles, such as the "Ife Chronicles" and the "Benin Chronicles," offered foundational accounts of early settlements, legendary narratives, and dynastic histories ~\cite{otterbein1966}. According to these chronicles, early settlements were established by legendary figures imbued with divine or semi-divine attributes, signifying their foundational roles in shaping the social and political landscapes of Edo/Benin City. Legendary narratives recount the exploits of these mythical progenitors, depicting their interactions with supernatural beings, the establishment of kinship ties, and the founding of sacred sites. Dynastic histories trace the lineage of ruling families and the succession of kingship within the Edo/Benin polity, highlighting key moments of political consolidation, territorial expansion, and cultural innovation. Through a blend of historical fact and mythic symbolism, these chronicles offer insights into the deep-rooted traditions and cultural heritage underpinning the identity of Edo/Benin City.

\textbf{Colonial Records:} The colonial era ushered in a new era of documentation, with European explorers, missionaries, and administrators recording detailed observations of indigenous societies and governance structures. Archival collections housed in national archives and colonial repositories, including the National Archives of Nigeria and the British Library, yielded valuable correspondence, reports, and surveys shedding light on colonial encounters and administrative reforms in the Edo/Benin region ~\cite{oliver1985}.

\textbf{Travelogues and Expedition Accounts:} Travelogues and expedition accounts penned by explorers, traders, and ethnographers provided firsthand descriptions of landscapes, settlements, and cultural practices in the Edo/Benin hinterlands. Notable works such as Richard Burton's "A Mission to Gelele, King of Dahomey" and Mary Kingsley's "Travels in West Africa" offered vivid portrayals of local customs, traditions, and historical landmarks ~\cite{burton2011} and ~\cite{kingsley1988}.

\textbf{Archaeological Reports:} The rich archaeological heritage of Edo/Benin City yielded a wealth of material culture and stratigraphic data, as documented in archaeological reports and excavation findings. Reports from pioneering archaeologists such as Thurstan Shaw, Graham Connah, and Ekpo Eyo provided crucial insights into ancient Benin's material culture, settlement patterns, and technological advancements ~\cite{shaw1970,connah1975}. Shaw's 1979 report delved into excavations, revealing evidence of urban planning, architectural structures, and material culture indicative of a burgeoning city. Connah's work from 1975 focused on settlement patterns, technological innovations, and social organization within ancient Benin, shedding light on the processes that contributed to its urbanization. Eyo's report from 1980 provided insights into the stratigraphic data and chronological sequence of cultural developments in the region, offering valuable context for understanding the transition from Edo to Benin City. These archaeological findings collectively contribute to our understanding of the socio-cultural and economic dynamics accompanying the city's transformation over time.

\textbf{Oral Traditions and Indigenous Knowledge:} Recognizing the importance of oral traditions as repositories of collective memory and cultural heritage, local communities and indigenous scholars documented oral histories, folk tales, and place-name traditions associated with Edo/Benin City. Transmitted across generations, these narratives offered nuanced perspectives on the socio-cultural dynamics shaping the toponymic landscape. One oral tradition recounted by local communities involved narratives of migration, conquest, and settlement that contributed to the transformation of Edo into Benin City. For instance, stories of legendary figures or ancestral rulers who led their people to establish a new capital marked the beginning of Benin City's emergence as a prominent political and cultural center. These tales provided insights into the socio-political processes, power struggles, and symbolic meanings associated with the city's renaming and evolution.

\section{Main Outcomes}

The analysis highlighted significant colonial impacts on place naming practices. Colonial authorities often imposed English or European names on geographical features, urban centers, and administrative districts. Despite these changes, indigenous place names persisted in local memory and oral traditions, serving as resilient symbols of cultural heritage and identity. The dynamic nature of place naming practices was evident, with linguistic diversity, cultural influences, and historical legacies playing a crucial role in shaping place names. These findings illustrate the multifaceted nature of place naming practices in Edo and Benin City and contribute to a deeper appreciation of the region's cultural heritage and identity.

\section{Visualization of Place Name Evolution}

Utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, the evolutionary journey of Edo to Benin City was visualized through maps and charts. These visualizations offer a spatial-temporal perspective on the transformation of toponyms over centuries, shedding light on the complex processes and historical events that shaped the city's nomenclature.

The figures \ref{fig:edostatemap} and \ref{fig:edobeninstatemap} were generated using data from ArcGIS online using its available online web application \href{https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html}{here}. All maps are created in compliance with ArcGIS licensing terms. Detailed processing steps included data extraction, geocoding, and visualization techniques to ensure accuracy and clarity. The map depicts the geographical region, including Edo and Benin City, and highlights significant characteristics like rivers, hills, woods, and metropolitan areas. The map distinguishes between indigenous and colonial-era place names by superimposing historical maps on contemporary datasets, using various markers or colors to indicate each.

In addition to the interactive map, several other visualizations with geocoded data were performed to gain further insights into the spatial distribution and patterns of historical place names. The heatmap visualization allows the density or concentration of historical place names in different areas to be seen, helping identify areas with high concentrations of place names and sparsely populated areas.
